# AboutTimeClient
A command line application to adjust the system clock on MacOS, Linux and Windows. This can be used standalone to modify the clock by an offset or it can synchronize to an external time source connected via a serial port. The time source could be a real time clock (RTC) module and/or GPS.

# Background
I developed this cross platform application to assist with running the amateur radio digital communication programs JS8Call and WSJT-X when operating off the grid (i.e. with no internet connection). This is because those applications require the computer clock to be within 2 seconds of UTC.

# Building the Application
I am reluctant to publish binaries particularly for Windows so you have to build it yourself! The only requirement for building is a C++11 compiler and I have tested this with Mingw-x64 and the Microsoft command line tools on Windows. On Linux and MacOS g++ can be used directly as shown below (note that you have to install Xcode on MacOS even if you are only going to use the command line tools).
 
I use the following two platform independent libraries:

    serial - https://github.com/yan9a/serial (serial port library)
    cxxopts - https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts (command line parsing library)
 
Both of those libraries are licensed under the MIT license and are included in the repository.
 
Building on Windows with MS tools (from the developer command prompt):

    cl /EHsc main.cpp ceSerial.cpp /link /OUT:AboutTimeClient.exe
    
Building on Windows with mingw-x64 (from the command prompt after path is updated):

    g++ main.cpp ceSerial.cpp -o AboutTimeClient.exe -std=c++11
    
Building on MacOS or Linux (including Raspian):

    g++ main.cpp ceSerial.cpp -o AboutTimeClient -std=c++11
        
# Running the Application
In order to set the clock this application has to be run with administor priviledges, this means run under a command prompt that has been opened to run as administrator on Windows and use sudo on MacOS or Linux.

The command line options are as follows:

	-i, --init        False
	-p, --port PORT   Port
	-h, --help        Print help
	-o, --offset arg  Offset


The port option is only needed when syncing time to an external source (undocumented for now).

Here is an example to add 0.5 seconds to the clock:

AboutTimeClient -i -o 0.5

Note that if your computer is connected to the Internet and is using NTP to sync the clock then it most likely will change the time back right away.
